At some point someone will tell them what they should do for their own safety and they’ll think, “who the fuck are you?” and do their own thing. In scary movies, there’s safety in numbers.", horoscope_2: ""},

It’s hard to imagine a Virgo being so impractical as to find themselves in any setting in which a horror movie would take place. They would never get lost on an abandoned road, feel tempted to explore a now defunct insane asylum, and they’re savvy enough with real estate transactions not to purchase a house that was built cursed burial ground. They are the minor character we are only introduced to in order to seem them murdered in some spectacular way.", horoscope_2: ""},
